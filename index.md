### About Me

I am an economist working at the intersection of political economy, public economics, and econometrics. In my applied work, I study the societal consequences of digital technologies (e.g., social media algorithms, large language models). I am particularly interested in the emergence and amplification of bias in algorithmic systems and how these shape economic and political outcomes. I have also studied the impact of social media on protests, political attitudes, and gender norms. In my methods work, I develop models to extract structured information from unstructured data (e.g., texts, images, videos). My recent focus has been on estimating latent factor models (e.g., ideology, topics) using deep neural networks. 

I am involved in various initiatives at Bocconi, including the DONDENA AI and Society Initiative (DAISI) and the [Monitoring Democracy Initiative (MoDe)](https://monitoringdemocracy.it/). 

### Recent News
