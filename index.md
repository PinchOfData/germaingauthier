### About me

Hi! I'm currently a PhD candidate at the [Center for Research in Economics and Statistics (CREST)](http://crest.science/) and a doctoral affiliate at the [Institute for Public Policies (IPP)](https://www.ipp.eu/). I work under the supervision of [Alessandro Riboni](https://sites.google.com/site/alessandroriboni/). 

I visited the Center for Data Science, Law and Economics at ETH ZÃ¼rich for the academic year 2020-2021, invited by [Elliott Ash](https://elliottash.com/).

I study topics related to political economy, with a particular focus on social norms, social movements and ideology. I draw from methods in applied econometrics and computational linguistics. 

I am also an active developer of [relatio](https://github.com/elliottash/narrative-nlp), a python package to mine narrative statements from large text corpora.
