I am a PostDoc in the [Law, Economics, and Data Science Group](https://lawecon.ethz.ch/) at [ETH ZÃ¼rich](https://ethz.ch/de.html). 

In September 2023, I will join the [Department of Social and Political Sciences](https://sps.unibocconi.eu/) at [Bocconi University](https://www.unibocconi.eu/wps/wcm/connect/Bocconi/SitoPubblico_EN/Navigation+Tree/Home/) as an Assistant Professor of Economics.

I conduct methodological and applied work at the intersection of economics and political science.
