I am an Assistant Professor at the [Department of Social and Political Sciences](https://sps.unibocconi.eu/) at [Bocconi University](https://www.unibocconi.eu/wps/wcm/connect/Bocconi/SitoPubblico_EN/Navigation+Tree/Home/).

I conduct methodological and applied work at the intersection of economics and political science. In my applied work, I study the impact of digital technologies on our societies. I have notably written on social media's role in developing large-scale social movements and, more recently, how their recommender algorithms affect users' political and economic beliefs. In my methodological work, I develop new machine-learning tools for social scientists, with a particular focus on text as data. Lately, I have been mainly interested in building NLP models that draw from recent technological innovations in computer science (e.g., transformers) but that (i) remain interpretable and (ii) are built with the estimation of treatment effects in mind. My research connects with many other topics/fields, including gender, crime, and public policy evaluation.
