I am an Assistant Professor at the [Department of Social and Political Sciences](https://sps.unibocconi.eu/) at [Bocconi University](https://www.unibocconi.eu/wps/wcm/connect/Bocconi/SitoPubblico_EN/Navigation+Tree/Home/).

I work on various topics at the intersection of economics and political science. In my applied work, I study the impact of digital technologies on our societies. I have notably written on social media's role in developing large-scale social movements and, more recently, how their recommender algorithms affect users' political and economic beliefs. In my methodological work, I develop new machine-learning tools for social scientists, with a particular focus on text as data. My research often connects with other topics/fields, including gender, crime, and public policy evaluation.
