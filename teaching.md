**Diversity and Global Policy (Bocconi, 2023)**

<details>
  <summary>Course Description</summary>

This course discusses diversity, fairness, and efficiency from a global perspective. A particular emphasis is put on issues related to gender and ethnicity/race. The course addresses several fundamental questions: How should we define diversity? Why do we value it? What explains observed differences in outcomes across groups? Which policies and interventions work to promote diversity, and which don't? How does diversity relate to notions of fairness and efficiency? It provides students with the basic facts regarding unequal treatment worldwide and the analytical tools to (i) understand its origins and (ii) assess the effectiveness of corrective policies. This proves helpful when thinking of diversity within organizations (companies, NGOs, and international organizations) and society at large.

<details>
  <summary>Course Description</summary>

This course aims to discuss current topics in Public Finance and study government intervention in the economy from a normative perspective. The course addresses the fundamental questions of public finance: When should the government intervene in the economy? How might the government intervene? What is the effect of those interventions on economic outcomes? Why do governments choose to intervene in the way that they do? What drives the design of social insurance schemes, the welfare state, and the tax system? The course trains students to understand the need for and the limitations of the public sector, as well as how State intervention in the economy can be improved. This proves helpful in analyzing and forecasting policy decisions by market analysts or professionals working in government or international organizations.

  <summary>Course Description</summary>

Natural language processing (NLP) holds great promise for economic and social science applications by providing ways to analyze large amounts of text data quickly and accurately. We provide an overview of text as data methods, including dictionary-based methods, measures of text distance, topic models, embeddings, applications of supervised learning, syntactic and semantic parsing, and sequence models. We illustrate every method with various social science applications.
