**Relatio** is a Python package to extract simple narrative statements from large text corpora (e.g., "Taxes ruin the economy.", "Democrats stole the election.", "People are losing their jobs."). 

For a given corpus, we map semantic relationships between K latent entities. The number of latent entities is chosen by the user (we offer quantitative metrics for a data-driven choice). 

Our package then allows users to plot narratives as directed multigraphs ([some examples](https://sites.google.com/view/trump-narratives/trump-tweet-archive)). 

The method is described in greater detail in the [original paper](https://arxiv.org/abs/2108.01720). 

Check out the [PyPi version](https://pypi.org/project/relatio/) and the [latest development version](https://github.com/relatio-nlp/relatio) for your own applications.
