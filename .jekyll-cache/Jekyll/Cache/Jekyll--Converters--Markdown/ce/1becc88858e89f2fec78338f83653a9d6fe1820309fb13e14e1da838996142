I"Ë<h3 id="about-me">About me</h3>

<p>Hi! Iâ€™m currently a PhD candidate at the <a href="http://crest.science/">Center for Research in Economics and Statistics (CREST)</a> and a doctoral affiliate at the <a href="https://www.ipp.eu/">Institute for Public Policies (IPP)</a>. I work under the supervision of <a href="https://sites.google.com/site/alessandroriboni/">Alessandro Riboni</a>.</p>

<p>I visited the Center for Data Science, Law and Economics at ETH ZÃ¼rich for the academic year 2020-2021, invited by <a href="https://elliottash.com/">Elliott Ash</a>.</p>

<p>I study topics related to political economy, with a particular focus on social norms, social movements and belief formation. I draw from methods in applied econometrics (e.g., policy evaluation, custom econometric models) and data science (e.g., web-scraping, natural language processing).</p>

<p>I am also an active developer of <a href="https://github.com/elliottash/narrative-nlp">relatio</a>, a python package to mine narrative statements from large text corpora.</p>
